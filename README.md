Plot a graph, zoom it and find its minimum using a very crude method

This is a javascript program using D3.js v4. (My messings about to learn D3 and javascript)

It shows an animation of a crude optimisation of a 1 dimensional function using steepest descent 
with approximate first derivatives.

You can zoom the graph using mouse wheel.
